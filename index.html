                <h3>Poverty</h3>
                <p>Poverty is about not having enough money to meet basic needs including food, clothing and shelter. In families that are in this reality and have no help to get out of this, it results in the cycle of poverty.</p> 
                <h3 class="h3-margin">Poverty cycle</h3>
                <p>The cycle begins with a poor family that  have to send their child to work so they can have the essential needs, or at least something to eat. Normally that kid works more than 10h/day, so they don't have time to go to school, or to have some leisure. With this, children will have a lake of education, resulting in low opportunities to have a better job in the future and generating the continuity of the poor family.</p>

                    <h3>Child Labour</h3>
                    <p>Child labour usually comes from poor families with difficult access to education, with not enough economy, or the family don't have enough conditions to have access to a decent work. As a result, these children are forced to enter into the workforce at a young age, as a means of helping their families to survive. This is a consequence of poverty, and needs to be solved.</p>
                    <h3 class="h3-margin">Security</h3>
                    <p>Since children works in a illegal place, they have no security been provide resulting in physical accidents. Beyond labour laws business have to follow the Minimum Age Convention and the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention law by ILO, to avoid this situation.</p>

                <h3>Culture</h3>
                <p>Usually in the areas where this illegal work is practiced,  people treat this as normal thing, like in some areas in Brazil: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PCP2YzGfjA" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PCP2YzGfjA</a></p>

                <h3>Child labour in different countries (India and Cameroon)</h3>
                <p>In Cameroon, most children sell scrap metal gathered from landfill sites, risking their lives, with precarious conditions only to receive approximated 3 euros in the end of the day. The child labour basically became a cultural thing, in a way that ILO organization is calling this work "slavery like" conditions.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In India, there is a Bonded child labour, in which the parents of the child have a debit with a person, and then they leave theirs children with the person to pay the debits. nowadays, most part of the child labour had declined, due the government strict supervision , and the country joining efforts with UNICEF. </p>

            <h3>Solution - ILO</h3>
            <p>The ILO, is the most influential organization that is against Child labour, and together with UNICEF, they join efforts with some countries, to secure children to not work.</p>
            <h3 class="h3-margin">Final thoughts</h3>
            <p>Child labour is bad for the raising of the kids, but the family needs this to survive, so if the government don't help, this will continue to happens to a lot of family, in every country.</p>
